## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added — Svelte Migration

- **Full Svelte 5 renderer** — Complete port from vanilla JS to Svelte 5 with runes syntax (`$state`, `$derived`, `$props`), reactive stores, and component architecture.
- **27 Svelte components** — Modular UI: `RadarView`, `BriefingsView`, `HistoryView`, `TrackerCard`, `TrackerRow`, `ScannerSection`, `SummaryStrip`, `Topbar`, `SearchOverlay`, `ScannerSettingsModal`, `AddTaskModal`, `ScheduleControls`, `EditableField`, `ActivityTimeline`, `ConfirmModal`, `ConnectBanner`, `Toast`, and more.
- **Vite build pipeline** — `vite build` produces optimized `dist-renderer/` output with CSS code-splitting, Svelte runtime deduplication via `manualChunks`, and hot module replacement in dev mode.
- **Reactive store layer** — Centralized state management via Svelte writable/derived stores: `items`, `scanners`, `meetings`, `briefingsByMeetingId`, `history`, `kpis`, `filteredItems`, and UI state stores.

### Added — New Features

- **Demo mode** — `npm run demo` launches with realistic sample data and zero WorkIQ API calls. Separate `flightdeck.demo.v2` storage key — real data never touched. All dates auto-shift to current time so demos always look fresh.
- **Demo reseed** — `npm run demo:reseed` forces fresh fixture data on every launch, useful after fixture changes.
- **Automated screenshots** — `npm run screenshots` uses Playwright Electron support to capture 24 PNGs (12 views × 2 themes) for documentation. Captures Radar, Briefings, History, tracker card tabs (Activity/Overview/Monitor), scanner settings modal, add task modal, KPI strip, topbar.
- **Demo fixture dataset** — 9 tracked items across 3 scanners (Customer Escalations, Project Risks, Contract & Compliance), 4 upcoming meetings with briefing content, day briefing with priorities and time blocks, 12 history entries.
- **New vs Updated badge system** — Separated "New" (purple) and "Updated" (green) into distinct visual concepts across cards, rows, scanner filters, ticker, and Mission Control. Both badges show simultaneously when applicable.
- **Mission Control KPI strip** — 5 switchable KPI modes (Pulse, Mission Control, Heatmap, Momentum, Ticker). LATEST section with 3 most recent changes. NEXT MEETINGS section with cached meeting countdown.
- **Ticker tape** — Scrolling bar showing new discoveries, updates, and upcoming meetings with NEW/UPDATED badges. Click navigates to item with section expand + highlight animation.
- **Meeting caching** — Meetings persisted to store with `meetingsLastFetched` timestamp. Cached meetings load instantly if < 1 hour old and same calendar day.
- **Inline editable fields** — Click-to-edit for title, due date, owner, and done criteria directly on tracker cards.
- **Scanner config tooltips** — All 22 scanner form fields have descriptive hover tooltips.
- **In-progress filter** — Filter button added to scanner section headers.
- **Desktop notification navigation** — Notification click navigates to card with pulse + ring animation, without auto-marking as seen.

### Added — Color System

- **Semantic color tokens** — `--color-new` (purple `#bf5af2`) and `--color-updated` (green) in `tokens.css`, independent of `--color-success`/`--color-elevated`.
- **3 color conflicts resolved** — NEW vs In Progress (both were blue), Waiting vs Snoozed (both orange), Updated vs Complete (both green).

### Changed

- **Renderer architecture** — Migrated from vanilla JS DOM manipulation to Svelte 5 component architecture with reactive stores. All UI rendering is now declarative.
- **State persistence** — Moved from localStorage to `electron-store` via IPC bridge. Two stores: `flightdeck-data` (active) and `flightdeck-cold` (archived items >24hrs).
- **Build process** — All `dist` scripts chain `build:renderer` first. `dist-renderer/` included in electron-builder packaging. CI validates Svelte build.
- **Scanner defaults** — Removed unused "Group" field and webhook URL from config UI.
- **Default scan interval** — Updated scanner defaults.
- **Timestamp consistency** — Card pills, LATEST, and ticker all use same source (`lastChangedAt || discoveredAt`, not `lastRunAt`).

### Fixed

- **Version display** — Shows FlightDeck version (from `package.json`) instead of Electron version in topbar.
- **Svelte runtime deduplication** — `manualChunks` config prevents `effect_orphan` errors from multiple Svelte instances.
- **Immutable store updates** — Svelte detects item changes correctly.
- **Case-insensitive status/severity comparison** — Prevents false transitions in update history.
- **Monitor engine** — Only records actual status/severity changes, not false positives.
- **Scanner inline filter** — Auto-clears when zero results remain. Event propagation stopped on filter buttons.
- **Highlight animation** — Prevented double-glow on notification click.
- **Demo fixture statuses** — Uses valid lifecycle values (Waiting, Blocked, Complete) instead of made-up statuses.

### Removed

- **Legacy vanilla JS renderer** — Deleted `src/renderer/` (14 files, 5,801 lines) and 13 associated test files + test helper (6,487 lines). Total: 12,288 lines of dead code removed.
- **localStorage for app state** — All app state now persists via electron-store. Only `fd-theme` (theme preference) remains in localStorage.

### Documentation

- **README.md** — Rewritten from scratch for Svelte 5 + Vite + electron-store stack. Correct project structure, screenshots, demo mode docs.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — Rewritten with Svelte 5 runes, Vite build process, correct file paths, branch → PR → merge workflow.
- **architecture.md** — Rewritten with Svelte component hierarchy, reactive stores, persistence bridge, scanner/monitor engines, 6 Mermaid diagrams.
- **user-guide.md** — Added Demo Mode section with `npm run demo`, `demo:reseed`, and `screenshots` commands.

### Tests

- 33 new tests for New vs Updated badge separation.
- Updated persistence tests for meeting caching.
- Updated popout test for Svelte renderer path.
- Fixed test script to reference only existing test files after legacy cleanup.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- **EULA detection & auto-reconnect** — When WorkIQ returns EULA acceptance text instead of data (e.g. after MSI reinstall), FlightDeck now automatically resets the connection state and re-shows the "Enable WorkIQ" button so the user can re-accept the EULA without manual localStorage clearing.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-02
